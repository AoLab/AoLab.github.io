## Introduction

Computer Engineering Department of the Amirkabir University of Technology decides to create an IoT Laboratory for exploring new ideas and technology in 2015.
Prof Sabaei, Bakhshi, and Rasti were the core team of this awesome center. Other professors also contributed to the progress of this laboratory.
In 2017 after 3 years of struggling we decided to shut down this laboratory. Here is the last version of the website.
